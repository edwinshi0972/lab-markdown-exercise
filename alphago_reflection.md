### **What moment in the film impacted you the most, and why?**
> The moment from the film that impacted me the most was when AlphaGo won the first game against Lee Sedol. The reporters were stunned to silence, and I found the atmosphere to be very striking. It was hard for me to imagine the feelings that they had in that moment: the fear, anxiety, and helplessness.

### **How did AlphaGoâ€™s approach to decision-making differ from that of its human opponents?**
> A key aspect of AlphaGo's decision-making that differed from humans was that it did not care about the margin of victory when considering it's next move. This was reflected in it's use of "slack moves", which were moves that appeared to be "lazy" or not accomplish much. These types of moves were seen as very unintuitive for humans to play, but AlphaGo made good use of them to win game 5 of the match against Lee Sedol.

### **What surprised you about how AlphaGo learned or played the game?**
> I was surprised that the documentary referenced some kind of weakness that AlphaGo had. When I think of engines for chess, they are literally invincible chess machines that no one can beat. This made me surprised that there were potentially exploitable weakness of a Go engine, even though Go has more board state possibilitie.

### **Do you believe AlphaGo demonstrated creativity? Defend your answer.**
> I would argue that AlphaGo *did* demonstrate creativity. In the second game of the match against Lee Sedol, AlphaGo played a move that no human would consider (move 37). AlphaGo was trained on matches played by humans, so it likely never saw this move during training. This seems similar to an emergent property, where the model is able to demonstrate some kind of property post-training without the creator's knowledge of how it came to be. The creator's themselves couldn't understand the move, so I would say that AlphaGo "came up" with this move on its own, similar to human intuition/creativity.
